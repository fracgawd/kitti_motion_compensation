## Notes
* The namespace abbreviation "kmc" stands for "kitti motion compensation"
* This is an "east const" project, see [east vs west const](https://hackingcpp.com/cpp/design/east_vs_west_const.html)... get with the program -_-
* I use brace-initialization for almost everything so you won't see many equal signs :)
